<h1 align="center"> Listing products in a catalog using the using React.js and Commerce.js SDK! </h1>

In this guide, we will setup a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) application!

![Project outcome](project.png)

In this guide we're using Commerce.js SDK v2

### View demo

[https://jonamparo.github.io/commerce/index](https://jonamparo.github.io/commerce/index)

## Overview

Get your React + Commerce.js application started!

1. Setup your React application
2. Inject Commerce.js onto your application
3. Display your Commerce store onto your application

### Requirements

- Any Command Line Interface
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), v8+
- Any code editor

### Prerequisites

This guide suggests that you have knowledge of the following concepts:

- Some knowledge of React.js, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Some knowledge of how APIs work
- Some knowledge of the [command line interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=command%20line%20interface)

### Project setup

In this setup, we'll be using the React.js framework.

### 1. Install React.js

```
npx create-react-app commerce-app
```

### 2. cd into your project directory

```
cd commerce-app
```

### 3. Install and inject Commerce.js into your app

In order to fetch data from the backend, we need to install Commerce.js SDK:

```
npm install @chec/commerce.js
```

Once that's installed. Navigate into your project and open up the `src/App.js` file with your code editor. Now we can link up our Commerce to our application. Copy and paste the below code into your App.js file.

**src/App.js**

```javascript
// Import Commerce.js
import Commerce from '@chec/commerce.js';

// Let's get started by creating a new Commerce instance!
// To get your public key please visit:
// [https://dashboard.chec.io/setup/developer](https://dashboard.chec.io/setup/developer)
const commerce = new Commerce('PUBLIC KEY HERE', true);
```

Once the code is in your editor, let's add our [public key](https://dashboard.chec.io/setup/developer) to the code we just entered.

[Get your key](https://dashboard.chec.io/setup/developer)

```javascript
const commerce = new Commerce('PUBLIC KEY HERE', true);
```

### 4. Fetch the products from your store

Now that we've entered our [public key](https://dashboard.chec.io/setup/developer), we should be properly connected. Now, we can begin to fetch our data from our store. ðŸ¥³ If you haven't added items to your store. Make sure to do that. [Click this link to begin uploading your products now](https://dashboard.chec.io/products)!

Now that you've uploaded products, let's remove the code in your `src/App.js` so that we have a blank file. Now, let's copy the code below, and paste it into your `src/App.js` file. Note - This is a decend starter template to begin a commerce.js project.

**src/App.js**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Commerce from '@chec/commerce.js';
// Let's get started by creating a new Commerce instance!
const commerce = new Commerce('PUBLIC KEY HERE', true);

const App = () => {
  // This variable will hold our products data
  const [product, setProduct] = useState([]);

  // Fetches data from the Chec API to the "product" variable
  useEffect(() => {
    commerce.products.list().then(result => {
      setProduct(result.data.map(product => product));
    });
  }, []);

  console.log('Commerce Product: ', product);

  return <section className='product-list'></section>;
};

export default App;
```

**Make sure you still have the public key you entered on your Commerce instance.**

### 5. Confirming that your fetch was a success!

Now that we have the code above in our application. Let's check out our store! Let's begin by starting our local enviornment:

`npm run start`

**Open up your Browser DevTools (Console/Inspecter)**

You can open up your DevTools by entering the key combination with your working operating system.

- Windows/Linux `(Ctrl + Shift + i)`
- MacOS `(Cmd + Shift + i)`

Now that we have our DevTools up, navigate to the "Console" tab. We should see a "Commerce Product" message inside of our console. Expand it and you should see the information to your store. It should look similar to the image below. (See image below)

![Console Image](console.png)

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your connection to the store is a success! Now let's use that data that we're retrieving, and display it onto our application.

### OPTIONAL: Add styling to your project.

Let's also add some styling to give the project a nice touch.

1.  Head over to our `src/index.css` file.
2.  Remove all text from the file.
3.  Copy the code below, and paste it into the `src/index.css` file.

**src/index.css**

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #282c34;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}

a:hover {
  color: cornflowerblue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

.product-list {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 1fr;
  grid-column-gap: 0.75rem;
  grid-row-gap: 1.5rem;
  padding: 5rem 2.5rem;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 1200px) {
  .product-list {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  .product-list {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    padding: 5rem 0.6rem;
  }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .product-list {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}

.product {
  box-shadow: black 0px 0px 5px 0px;
  transition: transform 0.3s;
  background-color: #20232a;
}

.product:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
}

.product-image {
  margin: 1rem;
}

.img {
  height: 10rem;
  width: 100%;
}

.product-detail {
  margin: 2.5rem 0;
}

.title {
  color: cornflowerblue;
  margin: 0 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.description {
  margin: 0.5rem;
}

.price {
  color: gray;
  margin-bottom: 2.5rem;
}

a.btn {
  background-color: #f1c65c;
  color: black;
  padding: 0.8rem 1.6rem;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-color: #f1c65c;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a.btn:hover {
  background-color: #ad8b34;
  border-color: #ad8b34;
  color: white;
}
```

ðŸ˜… Now that we have that in our project! Let's display our data on the client-side.

## 6. Display your product onto your application

Now that we have our data being rendered into our `product` variable. Let's display our products!

**a) Add markup to display the name of our product!**

Inside of our `src/App.js` file, let's add some code to display our data to our application.

- Go to your `src/App.js` file
- Remove `return <section className='product-list'></section>`
- Copy the code below and paste it where you just removed code

**src/App.js**
(Line 19)

```javascript
return (
  <section className='product-list'>
    {/* Iterate through our product array and return/render it out onto our page */}
    {product.map((product, index) => (
      // Product box that holds our product information
      <div key={index} className='product'>
        {/* Image of your product */}
        <div className='product-image'>
          <img
            alt={product.name}
            srcSet={product.media.source}
            className='img'
          />
        </div>

        {/* Product details (name, description, and price) */}
        <div className='product-detail'>
          {/* Product name */}
          <h2 className='title'>{product.name}</h2>

          {/* Product description */}
          <p className='description'>{product.description}</p>

          {/* Displays price formatted with symbol($10.00) */}
          <p className='price'>{product.price.formatted_with_symbol}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    ))}
  </section>
);
```

Et voila! ðŸ¥³ Now we have our data displayed onto the client-side of our application!

## 7. Description fix!

Everything is looking good! Our image is showing, the title is glowing, the description is looking ðŸ˜±! Oh, no! The description is showing <p> HTML elements! It's okay, we can get that fixed! Let's go back into our `src/App.js` file. On line 9, right below `const [product, setProduct] = useState([]);` , let's add the following code below:

**src/App.js**

```javascript
// Helper function to express our description into a regular string
const regex = /(<([^>]+)>)/gi;
```

Now let's go down to our return statement and look for

```javascript
<p className='description'>{product.description}</p>
```

Let's replace that with this:

```javascript
<p className='description'>
  {/* Remember we added a helper function at the top of the file? This regex helps render this expression into a regular string without the HTML element tags. */}
  {product.description.replace(regex, '')}
</p>
```

This is a [regex](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) that replaces a special pattern that is within the text. So we made an expression that got rid of the `<p>` element from our description tag. Pretty neat!

## OPTIONAL: Add a buy button and link it to our checkout.

Inside the our `src/App.js` file, below this line `<p className='price'>{product.price.formatted_with_symbol}</p>`. Let's add this code underneath it.

```javascript
<a href={product.checkout_url.display} className='btn'>
  Buy now
</a>
```

Now we should have a buy button! If we go back to our page and click the button. You'll notice that it'll take us to a checkout page for that item. Awesome!

## Next steps!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You've built the client-side of our application successfully! Let's look at the next steps that you could do to extend your application, and have a fully working commerce application!
